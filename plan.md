# Implementation Plan

Systems to implement:
- Weapon System
  - Ammo logic (Ammo pickups on some monster deaths, spawns relevant ammo type; specific ammo bound to specific projectile type)
  - Projectile types (Normal, Rocket, Lob)
  - Different gun pickups with different ammo and projectiles (Rifle, Crossbow, Rocket Launcher, Minigun) Katana? :D
- Health System
  - AC_HealthComponent for easy integration on players and AI or any other distructables for example
  - Health Pickups (only for players)
 - Custom Movement Component
   - Wall Jump https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd1KZASjSy0
   - Rocket Jump*
   - Sprinting
